2019 for me was a *gigantic lesson*.

I learned to keep my life in **18 Kg** in a suitcase and a backpack.

I learned to accept having **failed**, and this year I did it **2 times** within 3 months. And I never felt *better*.

I learned to **travel constantly**, and I understood that the best thing is **to stand still**, if you want to build something. In motion, images come out blurred. The more you move, the more the images are *faded* and not close to the original vision.

I learned that **simplifying** is extremely more difficult than **complicating** and adding. But I understood how to do it, now.

I learned that sometimes, to add you have to subtract, and to subtract you have to add. It is a **zero-sum** game.

I learned that zero-sum relationships *are worth nothing*: it is really worth maintaining only the positive-sum ones.

I understood that, at **26 years old**, I am leaving the 20s and entering the 30s: but I have a partner next to me who doesn't weigh it on me and who endures (and supports) my obsessions, frustrations and twisted thoughts.

I understood that if I want to build something for others, I must in the meantime build something for **me**. Otherwise I am not strong enough to build truly meaningful things.

I understood that people come and go, but it is our **aptitude to know new ones** that really makes the difference.

I understood that [*I am not alone*](https://anchor.fm/jaack/episodes/6---La-Solidariet-Ai-Tempi-di-Facebook-e9rgnv/a-a17vhu9). On the internet, in work, with my philosophy. I understood that I am not weird, I am just myself. And I fight to be so every day, despite the world **screaming** at me to follow the current.

I understood that it is useless to look at the way **others** do things: we are not able to do them in the same way, and if we try we are just making a big mistake.

I understood that if I set goals for myself, I am able to reach them: at the end of 2018, exactly a year ago, I had set myself **20** goals, some more ambitious, others less.

I reached **16**.

**One** I didn't reach, but I improved compared to last year. **2** goals I abandoned, it is useless to force yourself. And I created a new goal.

*Fair enough*.

If I hadn't reached even one, it would have been a problem. And instead, seeing that out of 21 I reached 16, that is **75%**, makes it easier for me to let go of those in which I didn't commit too much. Counting also those in which I improved, 2019 for me was a positive year for **90% of the promises** I made to myself 365 days ago.

*Not bad*, one would say.

Everything changed since I started measuring what I do, giving it a value. Everything came naturally afterwards.
And I am a happier person, that's all. The goals I set for myself will change, but my system will always remain the same, adapting to the changes in my person.

In these last 12 months I created an image of life in my head: I see myself on **a chariot with two horses**, in the middle of a race with chariots. Obviously, whoever arrives first wins.

There are those who **fully trust their horses** and let them run wildly towards the finish line, risking running into dangers that the horses cannot notice.

Then there are those who **only trust themselves**: they exercise so much control over their horses that eventually they slow down and the horses rebel.

And then there is another type, the one who **understands that the strength of horses is to run very fast**, but that to reach the goal with ease, there is need for small adjustments from time to time, a caress and a pat of encouragement.
I believe that this last type always wins.

I want to be **this type**.

In 2019 I found the confirmations I was looking for in 2018, and **I could not have hoped for better**.

*Happy 2020 to everyone!*
