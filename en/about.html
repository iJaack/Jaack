<p>I've always had trouble defining myself.</p>

<p>I think this is a big problem, but I'd like to think to remain with this kind
of problem until I'm 30. Not being able to describe oneself is a way to
say that you're able to do a bit of anything. Or, at least, to be able to
easily adapt to a whole variety of situations. </p>

<p>I don't feel like I was born in 1994, my anagraphic birthyear, but on January 27th, 2014.
   That was the day I started <a href="http://tweaknology.org">Tweaknology</a>,
   a blog about tech and innovation, with a bunch of university mates.
   That is my first creature on the web.</p>

<p>Tweaknology doesn't exist anymore, but everything I learned of the web, I learned it
 from experimenting on it. And that's why today I need a space for myself on the web.
 A place to express my thoughts, my feeling and my creative thinking -
 brutally and egoistically speaking. I often find that my thoughts are positively
 perceived by the small audience that I built over the years.</p>

<p>From a few years now, I intensified my effort in doing research in AI,
  blockchain e 5G, of which I extensively wrote about in articles on Webnews,
  the digital newspaper I wrote for from 2015 to 2019.</p>

<p>My main job today is to work on the Campus Party italian community, creating
a network of communities in the italian ecosystem. I also like the dissemination
 of complex topics in simple terms.

<p>Here are my thoughts, unlocked.</p>
