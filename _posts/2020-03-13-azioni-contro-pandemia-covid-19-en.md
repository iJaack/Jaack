In these days of digital frenzy and spasmodic waiting for 6:00 PM for the update of the Civil Protection bulletin, I have been reported many initiatives to lend a hand. I summarize them here, in points.

*This post may be updated with new suggestions*

<h3>1. Stay at home</h3>

This is obvious, but it is never reiterated enough. Fortunately, in Italy (unlike what happened in China), we can still go running, grocery shopping, walking dogs.

<h3>2. Do not spread news if you don't have a source</h3>

There is nothing else to say, don't do it.

<h3>3. Make a donation to associations via Revolut</h3>

Revolut, the mobile banking app, allows you to make even very small donations. I made one of 70 cents. If we all made a donation of 70 cents, over 40 million euros would be raised.

<h3>4. Make a donation to hospitals on GoFundMe</h3>

On GitHub, volunteers are collecting an index of all fundraisers for hospitals. Even one euro to just one hospital is enough to make a difference -> [https://github.com/colibri17/covid19-italy-fund-raising/blob/master/README.md](https://github.com/colibri17/covid19-italy-fund-raising/blob/master/README.md)

<h3>5. Help research with your computer</h3>

Yes, ok, we are all day at the computer these days. But when we are at lunch, or at night when we sleep, we could let researchers also exploit the power of our computer to find solutions to global problems like, in this case, the fight against COVID-19.

This is possible with Folding@Home, a very simple service: just download the app and open the control center via browser to start helping. You can also help in teams, and for the purpose an Italian team of people who share their resources has been created. To register, you must create a username and a passkey, and enter the team name (236931) so we all contribute to the same goal.

### 6. Order a pizza

Let's keep the economy moving, ordering a pizza delivery, if we can afford it.

### 7. Buy the newspaper

Similarly, instead of buying the newspaper digitally, let's go to our trusted newsagent. Newsstands are still open and offer an information distribution service that we must not take for granted, especially these days.

### 8. Donate blood
There are stations to do so in many cities these days. Thanks Mike for the report.

### 9. Find 8 other things
Because there are never enough.
