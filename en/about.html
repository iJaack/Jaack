<p>I always had trouble defining myself. Then I stopped trying and started building things instead.</p>

<p>I like to think I was born twice. First in 1994, officially. Then on January 27th, 2014 — the day I started <a href="http://tweaknology.org">Tweaknology</a>, a tech blog with some university friends. That's when I started understanding who I actually was: someone who learns by building, who thinks by writing, and who can't sit still.</p>

<p>From 2014 to 2020 I did a bit of everything: tech journalism at Webnews, La Stampa and Saggiamente, community management for Campus Party, writing about complex topics — AI, blockchain, 5G — and trying to make them accessible to people who hadn't thought about them yet. I learned that the hardest part isn't understanding something complex. It's explaining it in a way that makes sense to someone who hasn't been living inside it.</p>

<p>In 2017 I made my first crypto attempt — e-learning courses and a small mining farm with a startup called DoubleBit. It didn't go great, but I learned enough to not repeat the same mistakes.</p>

<p>In mid-2020 I joined <a href="https://avascan.info">Avascan</a>, the reference blockchain explorer for the Avalanche network. Within a year we hit one million users. In 2023, Avascan became <a href="https://routescan.io">Routescan</a>, an Explorer-as-a-Service platform that now powers more than 100 blockchains. I lead growth, and Routescan has grown into one of the top providers in the space.</p>

<p>Since 2025, my focus has shifted toward something bigger: how do you build trust infrastructure for autonomous AI agents? I'm working on Eva — a platform trying to answer that question.</p>

<p>I'm also the proud owner of a Mac Mini that never turns off, running 7 AI agents, 29 cron jobs, and a trading agent called Mony that operates on its own while I sleep.</p>

<p>Here are my thoughts, unlocked.</p>
