I wish I could write a full article on everything that happened between Gamestop, r/WallStreetBets and Robinhood, but I don't have the strength. There was so much commotion that I wouldn't know where to start, I don't know enough, I don't have time to connect all the dots.

But I saved a lot of notes, that is conversations on Reddit, Twitter and various social networks, which I collect here, as if it were a notepad. First because it serves me to remember what I experienced from very close, and then because maybe it helps someone to recover pieces that they had lost of this magnificent manifestation of financial freedom from below.

### We must make them pay

I actually feel like this, when I never sell my crypto.

### Loosing 10MM

I don't know if I could remain helpless knowing that I am losing 10 million dollars just to wrong someone who has a wealth 100 times larger than mine. But probably because I haven't the faintest idea of ​​what it means to lose 10 million dollars, at most 1,000€.

### Robinhood was supposed to..

It is the irony of fate, and of the world.

### Stop selling

This was serious, but then in fact it turned out that Robinhood did not have liquidity to handle all buy orders, and indeed 24 hours later it took 1 billion dollars in additional liquidity from investors who did not miss the opportunity to increase their shares or enter the company.

### STONKS App

The beauties of the internet and of creating websites and apps.

### In the air
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It&#39;s happening. At 3-4:30pm PST a plane will be flying a banner over San Francisco that says<br><br>&quot;SUCK MY NUTS ROBINHOOD&quot;<br><br>and I slid the pilot some extra $$ to circle right above RobinHood&#39;s HQ for a while. Go take some photos, I don&#39;t even live there 😂<br><br>Here’s the flight path: <a href="https://t.co/iti3ik4or9">pic.twitter.com/iti3ik4or9</a></p>&mdash; Kaspar (@KasparCMS) <a href="https://twitter.com/KasparCMS/status/1355246224207609856?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 29, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

A legendary thread that goes against corporations.

### GME Go.. brrr
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Times Square right now <a href="https://t.co/h98ZVkrhru">pic.twitter.com/h98ZVkrhru</a></p>&mdash; Documenting Bitcoin 📄 (@DocumentingBTC) <a href="https://twitter.com/DocumentingBTC/status/1355595975449071617?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 30, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

And then there are those who bought advertising space in New York just to laugh at all this.

### A not exactly conspiracy theory

An engineer did an analysis on Gamestop shares, and sensed that something was wrong.. even if **I** didn't quite understand what. If you understood it, [write to me](mailto:hey@jaack.me) or [send me a tweet](https://twitter.com/ijaack94), I'm really curious.
