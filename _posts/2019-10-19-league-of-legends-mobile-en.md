LOL arrives on mobile.

The article could end right here, explaining itself for those who play it. Or rather,
everyone explains it as they want.
There are those who think that the experience of **League of Legends**, after 10 years of patches, seasons and new champions on the pc version, could be upset on mobile. There are instead those who think they are two different things, that one should not exclude the other.

I am not a League of Legends expert at all. I started playing when I saw the Campus Party eSports team, the Campus Party Sparks. Coach 'Cristo' gave me some tips when I did night gaming sessions, and I understood that LoL is a game that works well, like that, only on pc. Detailed controls cannot be had in the same way on console, nor on smartphones.

Watching the LoL mobile introduction video on YouTube (which you can find below) I think about the work of rethinking the gaming experience that has been done: the game developers thought of a user like me, making the mobile version.
I am almost never at home, I am often around or perhaps I don't have a powerful computer available to play decently. Or maybe I would also like to start playing but I can't
think of spending 40-45 minutes stuck in front of the computer, because it is too much time for me.

In the era where attention is the new currency of exchange, asking more than 20 minutes from a player who plays LoL for work is not a problem, but asking it from a user who plays in the evening and on weekends with friends and doesn't get stubborn too much for ranking, is definitely another matter.

And that is why LoL mobile is born: because LoL, in reality, has the potential to please everyone: it is a strategy game, extremely complex if you want to play at high levels, but also extremely fun if you only want to play a quick game.

And now, the slice of users of the second type will certainly increase.

League of Legends will arrive on mobile in 2020 on both Play Store and App Store. You can register at [this link](https://wildrift.leagueoflegends.com/it-it/).
