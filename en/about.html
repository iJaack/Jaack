<p>I've always had trouble defining myself.</p>

<p>I think this is a big problem, but I'd like to think to remain with this kind
of problem until I'm 30. Not being able to describe oneself is a way to
say that you're able to do a bit of anything. Or, at least, to be able to
easily adapt to a whole variety of situations. </p>

<p>I don't feel like I was born in 1994, my anagraphic birthyear, but on January 27th, 2014.
   That was the day I started <a href="http://tweaknology.org">Tweaknology</a>,
   a blog about tech and innovation, with a bunch of university mates.
   That is my first creature on the web.</p>

<p>Tweaknology doesn't exist anymore, but everything I learned of the web, I learned it
 from experimenting on it. And that's why I need a space for myself on the web.
 A place to express my thoughts, my feeling and my creative thinking -
 brutally and egoistically speaking. I often find that my thoughts are positively
 perceived by the audience that I built over the years.</p>

<p>From a few years now, I intensified my effort in doing research in AI,
  blockchain and 5G, of which I extensively wrote about in articles on Webnews,
  the digital newspaper I wrote for from 2015 to 2019.</p>

<p>I worked on the Campus Party italian community creating
a network of communities in the italian ecosystem, then on the contents of the digital events.</p>

<p>Since mid-2020, I intensified my efforts in the crypto world, that I tried to enter in 2017 with e-learning classes and mining farms
   (with the startup DoubleBit). joining and launching [Avascan](https://avascan.info), the prime blockchain explorer for the Avalanche network.
    Since then, I reached quite the few milestones: 1 million visitors on the website and a plan to become one of the most successful hubs to search
    data. Think of Google, but for decentralised finance (DeFi).</p>

<p>Here are my thoughts, unlocked.</p>
