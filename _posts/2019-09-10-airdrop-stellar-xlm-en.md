I bought bitcoin for the first time about 2 years ago. From then on,
for about 6 months, I traded (even daily), damning myself on all the
improbable cryptocurrencies that from one day to the next made +600% or even more.

I made money, I lost quite a bit (less than I made, luckily).

Now I am a HODLER, one of those who thinks only of accumulating and never spending.
I would like to become what the US newspapers, in 2018, defined as the
'Millennial crypto-millionaire'. Maybe in 20 years.

But I never stop informing myself, doing research, doing *research*, and understanding
what the next steps will be. And that's how a few months ago I downloaded
**Keybase**, an app that allows you to do a lot of things, including
chatting with others using the platform using a decentralized protocol,
storing files in a sort of decentralized cloud and using Stellar Lumens (XLM)
to exchange money.

An all-encompassing platform that however I haven't fully used yet, I must say.
Few are signed up, so there are few people to chat with, and the storage function
I don't use much because the majority of the files I use are in proprietary format,
like those of the iWork suite and those of Google Docs. Yes, I'm not very open source
in this sense.

In any case, yesterday I received this nice little message in the chat:

About 20 euros of Stellar on my account, and as many every month for the next two years.
OK, it's not a lot, but doing the math it's about 7100 XLM in two years, which today are worth
about 390 euros to date. The price could go up, as always.

But leaving aside the price, the move is very clever: airdrops are planned
to incentivize users to spend, because the more they spend the more the volume
of transactions increases, the more volatility decreases and the greater the reliability
of the same becomes as a currency of exchange. Stellar is establishing itself more and more
as the "real opponent" of Ripple, which is always named "the bank crypto".
Among bitcoin purists, XRP is just a scam, a fraud.

Stellar instead has a different history: it is more community-based, the platform
has foundations closer to those of bitcoin compared to Ripple and XRP.
There is a collaboration in place with IBM, but the efforts to power apps 'from the bottom up'
have been very many.

I haven't delved into the technological nature of Stellar, I'll be honest. I don't want to seem
presumptuous on the subject. One can understand the blockchain but there are dozens, if not
hundreds, of variants of a slightly different nature.

But the effort, through this airdrop that will release onto the market about 100 million
dollars (theoretical) in two years, is concrete. They take potential out of their pockets to
entrust it to users. And what better users than those of Keybase, which is a
platform that has excellent features but needs a push for mass adoption?

On the airdrop site all information is available in English, [this is the link](https://keybase.io/airdrop).
