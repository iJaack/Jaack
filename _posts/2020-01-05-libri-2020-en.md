As mentioned in the [2020 resolutions](https://jaack.me/blog/2020/01/02/buoni-propositi-2020.html), one of my main goals for this year is to read **52 books**. One per week.

It is an ambitious goal, I know. In 2019 I read about twenty, so I'm aiming to more than double. But I believe that reading is the highest ROI (Return on Investment) activity that exists. With 10-20 euros and a few hours of time, you access the knowledge distilled from a person's entire life. Even if you only take home one good idea per book, it is still an incredible bargain.

To help me choose the books, I did a lot of research online, asked friends for advice and looked at the charts of my favorite categories (Business, Biography, Psychology, Tech).

Here is a selection of the books I plan to read this year (the list is constantly evolving):

## Biography
1. **Shoe Dog** - *Phil Knight*. The story of the founder of Nike. Everyone talks very well about it.
2. **Steve Jobs** - *Walter Isaacson*. The official biography. I've already read it years ago but I want to re-read it with today's awareness.
3. **Elon Musk** - *Ashlee Vance*. Fundamental to understand the genius (and madness) behind Tesla and SpaceX.
4. **Permanent Record** - *Edward Snowden*. The story of the Datagate from the voice of the protagonist.

## Business / Startups
5. **Zero to One** - *Peter Thiel*. Rules for creating companies that create new things, not copies.
6. **The Hard Thing About Hard Things** - *Ben Horowitz*. The brutal truth about running a startup when things go wrong.
7. **Blitzscaling** - *Reid Hoffman*. How to grow at breakneck speed.
8. **Company of One** - *Paul Jarvis*. Why growing is not always the best strategy.

## Psychology / Mindset
9. **Thinking, Fast and Slow** - *Daniel Kahneman*. How our brain works and why we make mistakes.
10. **Atomic Habits** - *James Clear*. How to build good habits and break bad ones (basis of my system).
11. **Deep Work** - *Cal Newport*. Rules for focused success in a distracted world.
12. **Digital Minimalism** - *Cal Newport*. Choosing a focused life in a noisy world.

## Tech / Future
13. **Life 3.0** - *Max Tegmark*. Being human in the age of Artificial Intelligence.
14. **Superintelligence** - *Nick Bostrom*. Paths, dangers, strategies.
15. **The Inevitable** - *Kevin Kelly*. Understanding the 12 technological forces that will shape our future.

## Novels (Relax)
16. **1984** - *George Orwell*. Classic. Always topical.
17. **Brave New World** - *Aldous Huxley*. The other great dystopia.
18. **The Three-Body Problem** - *Cixin Liu*. Sci-fi Chinese trilogy that is depopulating.

I will update this post (or create new ones) with short reviews as I finish the books.
If you have advice on titles not to be missed, write to me!

Good reading everyone.
