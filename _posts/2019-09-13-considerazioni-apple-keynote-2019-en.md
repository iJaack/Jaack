I finally watched Apple's September Event 2019 on Youtube (great thing that they broadcast it there too). Instead of an article, I preferred to simply put down a series of thoughts I wrote while watching the entire conference.

In the keynote, therefore, Apple:
* Wants the iPhone 11 to be mistreated, and has understood that in general the average user destroys the iPhone and keeps it without a cover;
* Declared that the iPhone 11 Pro design is 'all-new', so we don't expect a new design next year;
* Definitely flaunted mastery of the supply chain when the head of engineering spoke on stage and showed all the modules that make up the A13 Bionic chip;
* Showed TV series as products to be gifted;
* Imposed a new trend of policy and price configuration for subscriptions by putting TV+ and Arcade at €4.99 for 6 people ('Family' option);
* Demonstrated that for the Apple Watch there is little to improve, apart from the display that can be optimized for always-on and battery life;
* Wants to remind us that certain things can only be done with Apple products, as it does in every keynote;
* Wanted to challenge Google on machine learning when the head of engineering took the stage and explained how the A13 Bionic worked with a certain level of detail;
* Wants us to use the iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max for photos so much that it shows us all the types of photos that can be taken;

There are a few things I would like to point out:
* **Everyone** who took the stage thanked Tim with the same phrase ("Thanks Tim"), except for one person who thanked him with "Thank you Tim", while the only one looking in Tim's direction while thanking him was Phil Schiller. Coincidence?
* Employees of Apple never seen before took the stage, including the one who presented the iPhone 11;
* More representatives from companies outside Apple took the stage than Apple employees;
* Could a bundle of the Apple Music subscription at €4.99 arrive, or would it really be too much?
* They all had a hallucinating hurry in speaking, where are they running to?
* The main camera of the iPhone 11 does not have the telephoto sensor, so the whole range gains the ultra wide in addition, so Apple thinks that the telephoto is a sensor that deserves a higher price;
* Deep Fusion technology will be interesting, when it is released in the coming months.
