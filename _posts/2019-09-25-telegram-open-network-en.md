**Telegram** is my favorite **messaging** app.

Telegram is my favorite app to follow **news**.

Telegram is many things and, to put it briefly, is a free information platform.
And now it is about to become decentralized too.

In this page, I will collect articles written by me, resources taken from the internet
and considerations on new ways of using this app.

If you want to be sure that I answer you, [contact me on Telegram](https://t.me/ijaack94).

### The TON Wallet has been released in beta for the testnet!

Link to download TON wallet, now in beta -> [https://wallet.ton.org](https://wallet.ton.org)

Once the software is downloaded and installed, it must be configured, but in reality the procedure is very simple. You must remember to **save** the seed phrase to regenerate the wallet in a safe place, which has 24 words. I always recommend **1Password** and save the password as if it were a Bank Account, but **LastPass** and **Dashlane** are also fine, which are semi-free (1Password costs about €40/year).

Once the configuration is done, the screen is really simple. We normal users surely have 0 GRAM to redeem, but we can start playing with the testnet by requesting testnet GRAMs from a Telegram bot -> [Test-TON-bot](https://t.me/test_ton_bot).

Also on the bot the procedure is very simple, just indicate how many GRAMs you want to obtain on a scale ranging from 5 to 20. Who knows why such a defined number, since anyway the test coins have no value..

Generally, in about 1 minute the GRAMs should arrive.

Who wants to play with me on the TON testnet? :) This is my address: **EQCKFdRUi6GbTlhfS3Q_UmOncABG10zzh0wIJL0od1PoKNfa**
