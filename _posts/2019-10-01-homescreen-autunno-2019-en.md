And so we arrived in October.

I took a month to carry out a reasoned transition on my daily workflow passing through the homescreen of my iPhone.

On the left, the arrangement of apps until yesterday, which was the 'summer' arrangement. On the right, the 'winter' one, which takes into account completely different reasoning, but which does not drastically change the skin of my iPhone.

In order of appearance:

- **Scribd** goes out, because during August, although I thought I'd use it, in the end I never listened to an audiobook. At most I read, but mainly articles. **Working Copy** enters, because I'm getting used to writing daily on this site, updating modules or articles, and as an app for git versioning it is phenomenal.
- **Goodreads** goes out, moving to the second page, because I will read on weekends but by now I always remember to mark what page I arrived at. **Slack** enters, but positions itself in the bottom right corner, because the time has come to work and talk with the team daily.
- **Telepass Pay X** goes out, which unfortunately I haven't used much because it has many bugs and usage points (gas stations, etc.) are not exactly everywhere, or are not equipped. **Nike Training Club** enters, because between Milan and Vienna (the places where I work and live currently), I can exploit a gym and should be able to train at least twice a week, in addition to running more or less the same number of times.
- **PUBG Mobile** goes out, because until mid-October I will play with games that are on *Apple Arcade*, but I have already decided that I will play only with the Nintendo Switch. **Balance** enters, a guided meditation app from the same developers as Elevate which is creating the habit of meditating every morning for about 5 minutes, making me focus better and, for example, write this article in a few minutes instead of hours and hours of distracted and defocused work. A review will arrive shortly.

My homescreen changes based on habits, and I don't pretend to think it will always remain the same or that I will know exactly that I will use the apps I put on the first page. It is a continuous finishing operation. I will do it again in January 2020, probably.
