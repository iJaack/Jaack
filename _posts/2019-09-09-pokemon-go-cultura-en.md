I played Pokémon for my entire childhood.

I stopped playing Pokémon when I started university.
I'm not ashamed of it, quite the opposite. It is an integral part of my personal culture.

When **Pokémon Go** came out in 2016, I too wanted to become a Poké-trainer
like all the ex-kids of my era, which by now seems so far away.

The possibility of using augmented reality to create the artifacts of the little monsters
of the video game was imagined to take advantage of more realistic physics in the game.
To play having a Pokémon in reality.

But in reality the world has, as always happens, used this phenomenon as
a platform to do something different. This is what came to my
mind when I saw this series of posts on Facebook:

Pokémon Go has become an app to create a virtual reality platform where
Pokémon and humans can truly coexist.

Finally.

P.S.: on November 15th [Pokémon Sword and Shield come out on Nintendo Switch](https://amzn.to/31aWgQK). I already bought Sword. I won't fail to say what I think about it.
